About Mantid
============

The Mantid project provides a framework that supports high-performance
computing and visualisation of materials science data.
Mantid has been created to manipulate and analyse neutron scattering and muon spectroscopy data,
but could be applied to many other techniques.
The framework is open source and
`supported on multiple target platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac). <https://download.mantidproject.org/>`_
It includes and benefits from `many other open source projects <https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/main/DEPENDENCY_LICENSES.md>`_.

Development
===========

The Mantid source is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid>`_.
There are pages on `getting started with development <https://developer.mantidproject.org/GettingStarted.html>`_,
`issue tracking <https://developer.mantidproject.org/IssueTracking.html>`_,
and more on the development process, tools, testing, etc. on our `developer documentation <https://developer.mantidproject.org/>`_.

Governance
==========

Mantid is an open-source project with `many contributors <https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/graphs/contributors>`_.
The project is governed by a steering committee separated into 2 working groups:
the `Scientific Working Group <https://github.com/mantidproject/governance/tree/main/scientific-working-group>`_ &
the `Technical Working Group <https://github.com/mantidproject/governance/tree/main/technical-working-group>`_.
Each group formulates a roadmap for future developments from either a scientific
or technical perspective.
For full details of the governance model please see
`the governance document <https://github.com/mantidproject/governance/blob/main/governance.md#revised-governance-structure-2021---present>`_.
