About Mantid
============
The Mantid project provides a framework that supports high-performance computing and visualisation of materials science data.
Mantid has been created to manipulate and analyse neutron scattering and muon spectroscopy data, but could be applied to many other techniques.
The framework is `open source <https://www.mantidproject.org/Mantid_About.html#License_and_Distribution>`_ and `supported on multiple target platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac). <https://download.mantidproject.org/>`_ It includes and benefits from `many other open source projects <https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/master/DEPENDENCY_LICENSES.md>`_

Development
===========
Mantid is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/mantidproject>`_. There are pages on `getting started with development <https://developer.mantidproject.org/GettingStarted.html>`_, `issue tracking <https://developer.mantidproject.org/IssueTracking.html>`_, and more on the development process, tools, testing, etc. on our `developer documentation <https://developer.mantidproject.org/>`_.
