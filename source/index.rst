About Mantid
============
The Mantid project provides a framework that supports high-performance computing and visualisation of materials science data.
Mantid has been created to manipulate and analyse neutron scattering and muon spectroscopy data, but could be applied to many other techniques.
The framework is open source and supported on multiple target platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac). It includes and benefits from many other open source projects

Development
===========
Mantid is hosted on GitHub
